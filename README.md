# Ikzoekmiauw

This is a side project where I will be designing a Django web application for the fictional cat shelter Ikzoekmiauw.
Currently the project is at the starting phase. However, I am hoping to implement the skills learned 
in Coursera's Professional Certificate "Back-End Developer" in this project.
